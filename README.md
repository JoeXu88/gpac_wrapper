## gpac_wrapper
use gpac to wrapper mp4 container

gpac repo: https://github.com/gpac/gpac

this wrapper is refered to blog [使用gpac封装mp4](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43549602/article/details/84571906)

But I try to make it more strong and fix some bugs.

Now it only supports h264 and h265.

Next step:
* add AAC support
